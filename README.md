# Alzheimer's Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on implemented and evaluating deep learning models for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. Three different models are explored: VGG16, a custom made CNN, and AlexNet. The dataset used for training and testing consists of images categorized into two classes: "Abnormal" and "Normal."

## Models Implemented

### 1. VGG 16

VGG16 is a widely used CNN architecture. The model is trained and evaluated on the provided dataset. Accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix are visualized.

### 2. My Model

A custom CNN is implemented with hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner. The best hyperparameters are selected based on validation accuracy. The model is trained, evaluated, and performance metrics are calculated.

### 3. AlexNet

AlexNet is a classic CNN architecture that is implemented and trained to see the difference between the previous two. The mode's accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and additional metrics (F1 score, precision, and recall) are presented.

## Results

Visualizations of accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix for each model are provided, along with additional performance metrics for the AlexNet model.
